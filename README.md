Hi, my name is Collin Caldwell, and I am an aspiring Software Engineer

I am currently enrolled in the University of California, Irvine for Computer Science and 
have graduated from Saddleback College with both an A.S. (Computer Science) and A.A. (Business Economics)

I plan to continue pursuing both computer science and business, with a focus on completing computer science, with the ultimate goal being a masters in both

My interests in computer science range greatly in topic.
I am interested in everything from cryptography, web design, machine learning, to even rendering
I plan to explore many of these aspects with personal projects and hopefully soon start professionally as a software engineer
